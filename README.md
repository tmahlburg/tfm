# tfm
Simple file manager implemented in Qt for Python (Qt6). This project aims to create a simple, desktop agnostic, linux file-manager.
The initial version is going to be implemented in Python, though this might change in a later version, if there are performance problems.
The project is in an alpha stage right now and thus it is not advised to use it at the moment.
If you still want to try it, see below.

## Features
* basic directory traversal
* window layout with toolbar, statusbar, main table view, fs tree, bookmarks and mounts
* open files using xdg-open
* cut, copy, paste (with progress information), rename
* named bookmarks to directories
* show/hide dotfiles
* throw files and directories in the trash
* drag and drop (always moves)
* cli to open with a path or file url supplied
* show, mount and unmount devices and iso files using udisks2
* auto extract zip and tar files

## How to install
There are python packages for the alpha version to download on pypi. Install at your own risk using:
```
pip install tfm
```
Then run using:
```
python3 -m tfm
```

## Screenshots
Coming soon.

#### ui
* drag and drop folders as bookmarks in the bookmark view

### Beyond 1.0 (most of these are maybes)
